### A collection of procedures curated specifically for the JLab installation of NX/TC  
This list is (currently) aimed at events that are not used often enough for them to remain committed to (my) memory  

## How-to
- [CHANGE OUT SHEET SIZE](change-sheet-size.md) - Switch from one drawing size to another, without creating a new drawing [[ pdf ]](change-sheet-size.pdf)  
- [Dash Parts-List](Dash_No_Assy_Parts_List.pdf) - convert a standard (single-configuration) parts-list into a multi-configuration parts-list
- [Title-Block update/swap](title-block-11-18.md) - Replace malfunctive title-block with spiffy newness [[ pdf ]](Title_Blocks_11-15-18.pdf)
- [MULTIPLE PARTS LISTS ON A SINGLE DRAWING](multiPartsLists.pdf)
- [export assemblies to native](Export_Assemblies_Teamcenter_to_Native_NX.htm)
- [Section View (legacy tool)](sectionLegacy.md) - This Section tool allows more flexibility to creating section views. Deprecated because of file-size/performance cost

## Resolving issues/errors
- [Save-as](saveAs.pdf)  
- [Internal error/Memory access violation](Internal_Errors_NX12.pdf)
- [Unexpected structure of in-sync assembly](syncStructure.md)
