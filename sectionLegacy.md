# Finding the (legacy) section view command
This legacy section command allows a much larger range of section-ability.
The legacy tool allows the user to create a section based on a sketch. This way, the shape of the section can be infinitely adjusted to create great views for presentation.  
The existing tool is limited to sectioning everything by selecting one plane.

**right-click toolbar > customize > search "section"**
